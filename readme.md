# üåø LeafOS  
### Lightweight, Experimental, and Open-Source Operating System   (DRIVERS !)

## üß† About LeafOS

LeafOS is a **free, open-source operating system** built entirely from scratch ‚Äî  
designed to be lightweight, modular, and educational.  

It follows a **monolithic kernel** structure inspired by Linuxi,  
but everything in LeafOS is written to be **minimal and efficient**.  

The goal of LeafOS is to teach the fundamentals of how an OS boots, switches  
into protected mode, handles the kernel, manages I/O devices, and interacts  
with the user through a custom shell.  

If you‚Äôre curious how real systems work under the hood, LeafOS is a perfect  
place to explore.

## üí¨ Philosophy

> ‚ÄúSimple. Transparent. Free.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî The LeafOS Development Vision  

LeafOS isn‚Äôt meant to compete with Linux, but to **complement** it.  
It‚Äôs a hands-on learning project that exposes what‚Äôs hidden deep inside modern systems.  

Every single line of code is understandable, modifiable, and extendable ‚Äî  
from boot to kernel.
